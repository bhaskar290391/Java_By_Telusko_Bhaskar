Exploring OOP in Java: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, and Core Principles
Design a basic employee management system in Java using object-oriented principles.

You need to:

Create a base class Employee with:

Private fields: name (String), salary (double)

A constructor to initialize these fields

Public getter methods

A method getDetails() that returns:

Name: {name}, Salary: {salary}


Create a subclass Manager that:

Has an additional private field: department (String)

Uses super() to call the parent constructor

Overrides getDetails() to include the department:

Name: {name}, Salary: {salary}, Department: {department}


In the main() method:

Create one Employee object and one Manager object

Store both in variables of type Employee

Print their details using the getDetails() method

This will demonstrate how inheritance and polymorphism work in Java.


Instructions:

Define class Employee and subclass Manager.

Keep fields private and use a constructor to set values.

Override getDetails() in the subclass to extend functionality.

Use super() and this keywords appropriately.

Print output using System.out.println() and match formatting.

Expected Output:
  Name:  Alice,  Salary:  50000.0

  Name:  Bob,  Salary:  80000.0,  Department:  IT

class Employee{

    private String name;
    private double salary;

    public Employee(String name, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void getDetails(){
        System.out.println( "Name:"+name +", Salary:"+salary);
    }

}

class Manager extends Employee{
    private String department;

    public Manager(String name, double salary,String department) {
        super(name, salary);
        this.department=department;
    }

    public void getDetails(){
        System.out.println( "Name:"+super.getName() +", Salary:"+super.getSalary() +" ,Department: "+department);
    }


}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Employee emp=new Employee("Alice", 50000);
        Employee emp1=new Manager("Bob", 80000,"IT");

        emp.getDetails();
                emp1.getDetails();

    }
}
